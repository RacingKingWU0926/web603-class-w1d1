## Getting Started

### Install `react` and `reactDOM`

Run 
```bash
$ npm install react react-dom
```

Alternatively, you can set up React by CDN instead of using NPM, if your application does not use NPM as its server setup.

Then git-ignore the folder `node_modules`.

Then complete the demo along the class.
