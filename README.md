# web603-class-w1d1

## Getting Started

### Install `react` and `reactDOM`

Run 
```bash
$ npm install react react-dom
```

Alternatively, you can set up React by CDN instead of using NPM, if your application does not use NPM as its server setup.

Then git-ignore the folder `node_modules`.

Then complete the demo along the class.

## Description

There are 7 demos in this class. Demo 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 involves small amount of code additions.

Demo 6 is creating a React application and has its own instructions.

Results are attached in the `/screenshots` folder.
